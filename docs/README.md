![Project Banner](images/banner.jpg) 

## Introduction  
The **Smart Vehicle Tracking and Management System** leverages cutting-edge IoT and sensor technologies to enhance vehicle safety and operational efficiency. It integrates real-time tracking, accident detection, and notifications for unauthorized disconnections, ensuring comprehensive vehicle and cargo management. Combining GPS, GSM, accelerometer, and cloud solutions, the system addresses critical challenges in the transportation sector.  

## Key Features  
- **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:** Monitor vehicle locations with precision.  
- **Accident Detection:** Instantly alerts administrators in the event of an accident.  
- **Unauthorized Disconnection Alerts:** Notifies on tampering or unauthorized device disconnections.  
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracks cargo temperature and humidity.  
- **Administrative Control:** Features an admin panel for efficient vehicle and data management.  

## Problem Statement  
Current vehicle management systems often lack affordable, comprehensive solutions for real-time tracking and operational management. This project bridges that gap, improving safety, efficiency, and decision-making for fleet operations.

Data generated by sensors is securely transmitted to the AWS cloud, processed in real-time, and displayed on an intuitive admin dashboard.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Communication Protocols:** Wi-Fi, GSM 
- **Cloud Solutions:** AWS IoT Core, S3, and EC2  
- **Visualization:** Real-time dashboards with alerts and key metrics  

## Project Goals  
- Enhance driver and vehicle safety  
- Improve cargo management and operational oversight  
- Provide actionable insights through data-driven analysis  

## System Workflow  
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors gather real-time data such as location, speed, and environmental conditions.  
2. **Data Transmission:** Data is securely sent to the AWS cloud.  
3. **Processing & Storage:** Real-time and historical data processing is handled in the cloud.  
4. **Visualization & Alerts:** Admin dashboards display actionable insights and send alerts for anomalies.
